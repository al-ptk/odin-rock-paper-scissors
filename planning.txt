Below is some ramblings to Understand-Plan-Conquer:

To play rock-paper-scissors with the computer

Rps is played by two players picking one of three options and comparing them.
The rule for which wins which is as follow:
rock > scissors > paper > rock, where '>' reads as 'beats'
If the same sign is picked by both, there is a tie.

My Pseudocode:
function play game
human picks sign
    computer picks sign
    check signs
        if human.sign equals computer.sign:
            show its a tie
        else if human.sign beats computer.sign:
            show human wins
        else if computer.signs beats human.sign:
            show computers are the supreme overlords
        else:
            show somthing went wrong

confirms if user to repeat or not:
    if user wants to repeat:
        play game
    else:
        break

Pseudocode according to TOP:
function computerPlay (*args) => sign;
